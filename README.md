# Cypress Test Demo

## Description

The idea behind this was to simply get a chance to experiment with cypress testing. This is a very simple app with a very simple set of tests. You can see a simple set of tests [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zn35R6uSDyMkrItrcepMlC4hrd2DTnkW/view?usp=sharing) In doing this, my hope is to provide a decent basis for writing tests.

## Installation

Clone the repo then run `npm i`.

## Usage

Once installation has been performed, you have two options to see the tests in action:

1. `npm run cypress` will give you the more user friendly GUI version
2. `npm run test` will run the TUI interface. The advantage is that you can tie it in to other items.
